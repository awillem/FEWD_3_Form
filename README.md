**Project 3 - Treehouse Front End Web Deveopment Techdegree**    
***An Online Registration Form***

This project is about creating a mobile-first responsive form.  The project files included images of how the form should look on mobile screens and on larger screens starting at 768px.  After creating this project, I used flexbox for the majority of the layout.  

***Exceeds Expectations***
* added placeholder text to the telphone number field
* used the 'required' attribute on the name and email fields to add HTML5 validation
* made changes to the backgrounds.  Added a 'subtle' background to the main tag, a light pink background for the main content area, and a grey background to the footer.  Also, updated the submit button color to a brighter pink.
* added focus states for the input fields that add a border and change the background color.  These changes are set up with an ease-out transition.  The button has a hover state that changes the background color with an ease-in transition.
